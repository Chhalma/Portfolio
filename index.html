					<p class="text">
						My name is Chhalma Chhaya, and I live in London, United Kingdom with my loving husband and two wonderful children. On 25th of November,2022, I became an Oracle Certified Associate Java Programmer (OCAJP). Additionally, I have a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering and a Masters in Information Technology. During My undergraduate program I also led ACM(Association for Computing Machinery) contest.
						<br>
<br>
My IT career started as a Graduate Software Engineer at Reve Systems(Telecommunication and Software provider https://www.revesoft.com/) ,  where I worked as a part of a team to develop e-commerce-based software. As a full-stack developer, I used JavaScript, HTML front-end, PhP back-end and MySQL database. At Reve System, I led a team of junior developers who developed a POM for all Reve Systems entities. Our POM project was highly appreciated, by the senior management team, including the CEO. I worked at Reve Systems from January, 2011 to December,2011.

	<p>
		As I always dreamt to become Java Developer I have started my new career as Java Developer at Orbund System in Bangladesh office (https://orbund.com/). At Orbun System I have used Java Spring and MySql Database. I worked there until I moved to UK with my husband which is June, 2012. Then I took a long break from my professional career due to my family responsibilities. Now I am ready to pursue my dream job again.
<br><br>

		Though I was always under pressure of being a full-time mother, I never stopped dreaming or developing myself. I continued my professional development and undertook a range of software-related courses, including Python, GitHub, Bootstrap and many more from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology through edX and Udemy with above 90% marks.

		<br><br>
		Despite my experience working with PHP, WordPress, etc., I want to pursue a career in Java development.As part of my continuous professional development, I have recently completed the OCAJP (Oracle Certified Associate Java Programmer) certification with 87.4%.
		<br><br>
		Aside from my educational and technical background, I am very optimistic and resilient, well-organised, and good at managing my time. As an individual or in a team, I am capable of working under pressure. It is important to me to strive for quality and to try until I am satisfied.
